To generate a new theme, first you have to set your new "personallightcolour" and "personaldarkcolour".
Then proceed with the scripts.

To generate a second theme you have to change "oldcolour1" and "oldcolour2" to the value set in the first theme, then set your new "personallightcolour" and "personaldarkcolour" for the new theme. And proceed again with the scripts.
Alternatively you have to reset the themes files. To do so, launch the terminal and simply invoke:
$ git reset --hard
